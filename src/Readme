Commercejs
// Usually a commerce app will need a full backend api with full api with all the routes 
adding the products, deleting the products,
you need authentication and a lot all of this is stored in this instance

In the description it's showing Html text instead of normal text
    <Typography variant ="body1" color="textSecondary">
    {product.description}
    <Typography/>

    Changed to
    <Typography dangerouslySetInnerHTML= {{__html: product.description}} variant ="body1" color="textSecondary"/>
